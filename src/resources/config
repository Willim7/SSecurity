# Email providers may either be Gmail, HotMail, Disroot etc... (There are a lot out there)
# For each email provider they have a host where the plugin can connect
# to the mail server and send an email!
Host: "smtp.example.com"

# When connecting to a mail server some may have different ports
# if you are not sure ask your email provider or simply keep this at port 587!
Port: "587"

# This is where you input an email address, if you would like to be more
# secure I suggest making another email containing no valuable information
# this email will only be used to email players using email authentication!
